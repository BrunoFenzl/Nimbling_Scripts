Nimbling_Scripts
================

Scripts to enhance graphic workflows in Illustrator and/or Mac OS X

I have these scripts bound to shortcuts using redsweaters' Fastscripts - replacing several illustrator native shortcuts and adding a few.

I have them set up like this:
[CMD + 7] Clip retaining colors. Ideal for cell shading objects. Super smooth workflow when used with Dynamic Sketch.

[CMD + SHIFT + O] Outline both text and stroke, using the shortcut previously reserved only for text.

[CMD + SHIFT + H] & [CMD + SHIFT + V] Flip Horizontal and Vertical.

The Axonometry folder contains five illustrator actions sets that emulate different axonometries, of which the “SSR 30º” & “ISO 45º + Vertical scale” are likely what you want.

The “Flatland -20º & 30º” set is the one I used to create the cabinet
