Scripts to enhance graphic workflows in Illustrator and/or Mac OS X

I have these scripts bound to shortcuts using redsweaters' Fastscripts - replacing several illustrator native shortcuts and adding a few.

I have them set up like this:
###Clip scripts###
* [CMD + 7] "Clipper.jsx" AND [CMD + ALT + CTRL + 7] "Bottomclipper.jsx".
Ideal for cell shading objects. Super smooth workflow when used with Astute Graphics' Dynamic Sketch.

###Outliner###
* [CMD + SHIFT + O] "Outline Stroke and Text.jsx"
Outline both text and stroke, using the shortcut previously reserved only for text.

###Swap object colors###
* [CMD + ALT + CTRL + S] "Swap Object Colors.jsx"
This script swaps the colors of exactly TWO selected objects.

###Flip scripts###
* [CMD + SHIFT + H] & [CMD + SHIFT + V]
Flip Horizontal and Vertical.

###Axonometry scripts###
* The Axonometry folder contains five illustrator actions sets that emulate different axonometries,
of which the “SSR 30º” & “ISO 45º + Vertical scale” are likely what you want.
The “Flatland -20º & 30º” set is the one I used to create the cabinet
