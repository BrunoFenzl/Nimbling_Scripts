Scripts to enhance graphic workflows in Illustrator and/or Mac OS X

I have these scripts bound to shortcuts using redsweaters' Fastscripts - replacing several illustrator native shortcuts and adding a few.

I have them set up like this:
<CMD + 7> Clip retaining colors. Ideal for cell shading objects. Super smooth workflow in conjunction with Dynamic Sketch.

<CMD + SHIFT + O> Outline both text and stroke, using the shortcut previously reserved only for text.

<CMD + SHIFT + H> & <CMD + SHIFT + V> Flip Horizontal and Vertical.
