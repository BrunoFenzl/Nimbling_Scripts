Scripts to enhance graphic workflows in Illustrator and/or Mac OS X

I have these scripts bound to shortcuts using redsweaters' Fastscripts - replacing several illustrator native shortcuts (taking care to remove them from illustrator) and adding a few.

I have them set up like this:

###Clip scripts###
* (CMD + 7) "Clipper.jsx" AND (CMD + ALT + CTRL + 7) "Bottomclipper.jsx".
These clip scripts attempt to copy the initial objects appearance and paste it to the resulting clipping mask. Due to illustrator limitations this only works for single stroke, single fill appearances.
Ideal for cell shading objects. Allowing for a super smooth workflow when used with Astute Graphics' Dynamic Sketch; Simply draw an object, draw the shadow / highlight bits, select both and execute the "Bottomclipper".

###Outliner###
* (CMD + SHIFT + O) "Outline Stroke and Text.jsx"
Outline both text and stroke, using the shortcut previously reserved only for text.

###Swap object colors###
* (CMD + ALT + CTRL + S) "Swap Object Colors.jsx"
This script swaps the colors of exactly TWO selected objects.

###Flip Horizontal & Vertical###
* (CMD + SHIFT + H) & (CMD + SHIFT + V)
Flip Horizontal and Vertical.

###Send behind… & Send in Front of…###
* (CMD + CTRL + SHIFT + [) & (CMD + CTRL + SHIFT + ])
Flip Horizontal and Vertical.

###Axonometry scripts###
* The Axonometry folder contains five illustrator actions sets that emulate different axonometries,
of which the “SSR 30º” & “ISO 45º + Vertical scale” are likely what you want.
The “Flatland -20º & 30º” set is the one I used to create the cabinet
